  'Meet Skylar Gregory. Skylar is based in Tempe, Arizona (USA). He is the co-founder of Evertwine, a mobile app with a simple but powerful mission: to bring people together in person through shared interests. His journey to this point has been shaped by a lifelong entrepreneurial drive and a passion for building connections, both in business and in his personal life as an avid gym-goer and sports enthusiast.

## My entrepreneurial journey

I recently graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in Business Entrepreneurship, but my entrepreneurial journey began long before that. After my freshman year, I launched a successful pressure washing company, learning firsthand the challenges and rewards of building something from the ground up. While that venture was profitable, I felt a pull toward solving a more profound problem, one I saw affecting my peers and my generation directly. This led me to dedicate myself fully to Evertwine.

## What is Evertwine?

The idea for Evertwine was born from a paradox: despite being the most digitally connected generation in history, Gen Z is also one of the loneliest. This isn''t just a statistic to me; it''s a reality I''ve seen play out. The concept was truly solidified when a classmate shared a story about her friend who, after moving to Miami – a socially connected city – still struggled to make friends. It was a clear sign that the old ways of meeting people were no longer enough.

We needed a new solution, not just another app for endless online chatting, but a tool focused on creating fulfilling, real-world relationships. My co-founder and I designed Evertwine to be that solution.

Evertwine is a mobile app that helps people combat loneliness by facilitating in-person meetups based on shared activities, whether it''s grabbing coffee, going for a hike, or finding a new gym partner. The platform is built on a pillar of simplicity. Users can browse a map or an explore feed to find activities happening nearby, create their own one-on-one or group meetups, and easily connect with others who share their interests.

## Starting out

Our journey began in July 2023, initially with the idea of building a better dating app. However, we eventually recognized that the market was incredibly saturated and that our true passion lay in fostering platonic connections. In October 2024, we pivoted to our current activity-based model, officially launching on January 1st 2025. The first few months were a quiet beta period focused on development.

## Marketing wins

Building a community from scratch is a formidable challenge. We acquired our first 100 users in about a month, primarily through bootstrapped, organic promotion on platforms like Reddit, X, LinkedIn, as well as word-of-mouth. This was our main marketing push beginning May 2025.

The key to our early success was authenticity. We didn''t try to create artificial hype or use traditional marketing tactics. Instead, we focused on sharing our genuine story and the real problem we were solving. People connected with our mission because they could relate to the loneliness epidemic we were addressing.

## Lessons learned

The journey from concept to 100 users taught us several valuable lessons:

1. **Authenticity matters**: People can tell when you''re being genuine about solving a real problem
2. **Community-first approach**: Building relationships with potential users before asking them to download an app
3. **Organic growth**: Sometimes the best marketing is simply being present where your audience already is
4. **Iteration is key**: Our pivot from dating to friendship-focused app was crucial to our success

## Looking ahead

As we continue to grow, we''re excited about the future of Evertwine and the communities we''re helping to build. Our mission remains the same: to bring people together in person through shared interests and combat the loneliness epidemic that affects so many young people today.

The first 100 users were just the beginning. We''re building something bigger than an app – we''re building a movement toward more meaningful, real-world connections.',
